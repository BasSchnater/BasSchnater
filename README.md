Great to find you here! I am Bas Schnater, working as a data scientist / data analyst in football business & media (newspaper publishing). I'm interested in all things where football business and data science come together.

In a previous working life I've been head of CRM projects at Dutch football club @AZ-Alkmaar. Here, I've drastically improved season ticket retention from 78% tovi 95% (industry avg. = 85%) by using various transactional and behavioral data sets. This has led to 2nd place World Football Summit award. More information can be found here:

Currently, I work in publishing where I help newspapers understand online user behavior. Performing various machine learning techniques, we have managed to drastically increase reader engagement and paywall conversion. More information can be found here:
